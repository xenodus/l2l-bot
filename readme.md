## Newbie Learning Interest List

Just `!sub levi/plevi/eow/sos/wish/riven/scourge comments` to be added to a list to indicate to clan sherpas you're looking to learn a certain raid.

To unsub, `!unsub levi/plevi/eow/sos/wish/riven/scourge`. If you've change your discord nickname to your Battle.net ID, you'll be automatically removed from a list once you've successfully completed a raid. The bot checks for completion every 24 hours.
